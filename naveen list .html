        <dd>   There are two kinds of doughnuts: cake and yeast. Cake doughnuts (my personal favorite) are made with a sweet dough leavened by baking powder. These doughnuts have a tender, spongy interior with a slightly crispy exterior. Yeast doughnuts, on the other hand, use yeast to help the dough rise, becoming fluffy and light in the process. Theyâ€™re airy in texture and fry up to a golden brown color.</dd

      <h1>step by step preparation</h1>
      <ol type="I">
        <li>step;0Grease a large bowl with cooking spray and set aside. In a small, microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup, add milk. Microwave until lukewarm, 40 seconds. Add a teaspoon of sugar and stir to dissolve, then sprinkle over yeast and let sit until frothy, about 8 minutes</li>
        <li> step1;Dosa batter is made of fermented rice and black urad dal, which is an essential lentil. Pulses and lentils are super-rich on proteins, amino acids and give the body all the needed nutrition. If you want your dosa batter to be healthier, consider experimenting with ragi, oats or buckwheat</li>
        <li>step2;In a medium bowl, whisk together flour and salt. In a large bowl, whisk together remaining sugar, butter, eggs, and vanilla with a wooden spoon. Pour in yeast mixture, mix to combine, then add in dry ingredients, stirring with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead until elastic and only slightly tacky, adding more flour a teaspoon at a time if needed, about 5 minutes</li>
        <li>step3;Make glaze: In a large bowl, whisk together milk, powdered sugar, and vanilla until smooth. Set aside.</li>
        <li>step4;Transfer doughnuts to paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain and cool slightly. Dip into glaze, then place onto a cooling rack (or eat immediately!).</li>
